# Travel-Booking
The manual ticket booking and maintenance process results in wastage of time and energy both by the user and the travel management system. Thus providing a software for the process would result in saving of time and efficient management of data. The project aims at functionalities such as registration by the user, reserving seats and payment. The reservation process includes the user choosing the type of bus, number of seats , source and destination. Finally, the user will be prompted to pay through card.
